## Overview

Welcome to Flabs API documentation. Our APIs allow labs to integrate with the Flabs platform to create a seamless experience for managing patient data, reports, and lab workflows.

## Authentication

All Flabs APIs use token-based authentication. To access our APIs, you'll need:

1. **Client ID**: A unique identifier for your lab
2. **Client Secret**: A secret key provided to authenticate your lab

These credentials must be kept secure and should never be exposed in client-side code or public repositories.

<Note>
  To obtain your Client ID and Client Secret, please contact our support team at
  hello@flabs.in

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate with the Flabs platform:

### 1. Obtain Credentials

Contact our support team to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

### 2. Generate Authentication Token

Use your credentials to obtain an authentication token through our authentication endpoint.

### 3. Use the Token in API Requests

Include the token in the Authorization header of your API requests.

## Error Handling

All Flabs APIs follow a consistent error format that includes success status, error code, message, and detailed information when available.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure system stability, our APIs implement rate limiting. If you exceed the limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
